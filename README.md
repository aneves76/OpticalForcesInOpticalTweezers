# Optical Forces In Optical Tweezers

## Mission statement
This open source project is for Mathematica implementations of optical forces in optical tweezers. It relies on the generalized Lorenz-Mie theory (GLMT) and the highly focused beam described by angular spectrum representation. Other contributions towards writing this code in R, Python, and other programming languages are welcomed.
